<h1>As a student, I want quiet so I can study!</h1>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<p>
    It has been a while since I have been a student. I am usually the teacher!
     I have been a Pilates Instructor for over 10 years, 
     a dancer for many years before that, and most recently
      I help people who are struggling with 
      substance use disorder (drugs and alcohol overuse).</p>
      
      
      <p>I co-founded a company called REVA Recovery Support, and we use a holistic approach to recovery, includiong movement, meditation, 
      building self-confidence, and community.</p>

      
      <p>I am absolutly thrilled to be switching gears though,
    learning to code is something I have always wanted to do!</p>
